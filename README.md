# CORTEX

**Synthetic cognition infrastructure for AI agents.**

Memory that thinks. Not a vector database. Not a RAG pipeline. A cognitive architecture with learning, consolidation, decay, emotion, and reconsolidation, grounded in computational neuroscience.

---

## Why CORTEX Exists

Every AI agent has the same problem: they forget.

You can stuff context into a prompt. You can store vectors in a database and retrieve the top-K nearest neighbors. You can append conversation history until you hit the token limit and then summarize it into something that loses half the meaning. The entire industry is building elaborate workarounds for a fundamental architectural failure: AI agents don't have memory. They have search.

Memory is not search. Memory is a living system. It strengthens what matters, forgets what doesn't, consolidates patterns while you sleep, and updates beliefs when new evidence arrives. Your brain doesn't store a flat log of everything that happened to you. It builds a weighted, emotional, associative network that changes every time you access it.

That's what CORTEX is. Not a retrieval layer. A cognitive architecture.

I built this because I spent two years watching AI agents lose their minds every time a context window rolled over. I'd build something brilliant with an agent on Monday, and by Wednesday it was asking me the same questions like we'd never met. The tools existed to store information, but nothing existed to actually *remember*. To know what mattered. To notice when something contradicted what it already believed. To get better at things over time instead of starting from zero every session.

So I stopped looking for the tool and built the system. I went back to the neuroscience. Not as a metaphor, not as marketing language, but as an engineering blueprint. The hippocampus separates similar patterns so you don't confuse yesterday's meeting with last week's. The CA1 region detects novelty by comparing what arrived against what it predicted. Memories consolidate during sleep through a two-phase cycle that prunes the noise, strengthens the signal, and occasionally surfaces connections you never would have made while awake. Emotional experiences resist forgetting. Retrieved memories become temporarily malleable, so beliefs can be corrected instead of just appended.

All of this is in CORTEX. Running. In production. Powering a fleet of 27 agents that carry 25,000+ active memories, 1.9 million+ synaptic connections, 6+ months of uninterrupted nightly dream cycles, and a 0.00 identity drift score that means the agents wake up the same people they were when they went to sleep.

This is what I think AI memory should look like. Now it's yours.

### Core Subsystems

**Hippocampus.** Pattern separation via Dentate Gyrus sparse coding (4096-dim expansion, 5% sparsity), CA1 novelty detection with sparse gating, CA3 autoassociative pattern completion. Two similar inputs that would confuse a cosine search get pushed apart into distinct sparse representations. This is how CORTEX avoids the "every Tuesday meeting looks the same" problem.

**Dream Cycle.** Five-phase synthetic sleep. Resonance decay (Ebbinghaus stability-adjusted), adaptive pruning (percentile-based, not hardcoded thresholds), cluster consolidation with LLM-generated abstractive summaries, free association via random activation, and synthesis of novel insights from newly formed connections. Runs nightly. Your agent wakes up smarter than it went to sleep.

**Emotional Valence.** Six-dimensional emotional vectors (valence, arousal, dominance, certainty, relevance, urgency) attached to every memory. Emotionally charged memories resist pruning and get boosted during recall. Because what matters should be harder to forget.

**Reconsolidation.** When a memory is retrieved, it enters a labile window where it can be updated with new information. The old version gets timestamped (`valid_until`) and the updated version gets marked as current (`valid_from`). Beliefs evolve. They don't just stack.

**Temporal Validity.** Every memory tracks when it was true, not just when it was stored. `valid_from`, `valid_until`, `superseded_by`. Your agent can answer "what did we believe about this last month?" and "when did that change?"

**Procedural Memory.** Skills, workflows, and habits stored in a separate, decay-resistant layer. Proficiency tracked through execution count and success rate. Your agent gets better at things it does repeatedly.

**Autonomous Cognition.** Background reasoning threads (strategic, operational, relational) that query the memory graph independently and surface insights. Your agent thinks about things even when nobody's talking to it.

**Proprioception.** Self-diagnostic system that monitors its own cognitive integrity: orphaned memories with no connections, synaptic collapse, embedding/sparse-code consistency, and learning rate stalls. The system knows when something is wrong with itself.

**Metacognition.** Reasoning traces, weekly audits with bias detection, and a feedback loop that injects corrective artifacts when inconsistencies are found. Self-reflection that actually changes future behavior.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "cortex": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["tsx", "/path/to/cortex/src/mcp/server.ts"],
      "env": {
        "DATABASE_URL": "your-connection-string",

## Search Scoring

CORTEX uses a 7-factor hybrid scoring system:

```
score = 0.50 * cosine_similarity    (semantic relevance)
      + 0.20 * text_match           (exact keyword hit)
      + 0.15 * recency              (exponential decay, 30-day half-life)
      + 0.10 * resonance            (Ebbinghaus stability-adjusted)
      + 0.05 * priority_boost       (P0=1.0 critical ... P4=0.1 ephemeral)
```

Plus CA3 pattern completion boost and emotional recall boost in `--verbose` mode. This isn't just "find the nearest vector." It's a judgment call about what's relevant right now, weighted by how important it is, how recent, and how connected to other things the agent knows.

---

## Dream Cycle

Five phases. Two stages. Inspired by real sleep neuroscience.

**SWS (Slow-Wave Sleep):**
1. **Resonance Analysis.** Ebbinghaus stability-adjusted decay across all active memories. Frequently accessed, highly connected memories resist decay.
2. **Adaptive Pruning.** Percentile-based thresholds (P5 delete, P15 archive) computed from the agent's actual resonance distribution. No hardcoded cutoffs. Safety floors prevent catastrophic pruning. P0/P1 and emotionally salient memories are always protected.
3. **Consolidation.** Connected component clustering of high-resonance memories. LLM generates abstractive summaries that capture the actual insight, not just a list of entities.

**REM (Rapid Eye Movement):**
4. **Free Association.** Random activation of memory nodes for novel cross-domain connections.
5. **Synthesis.** Generate insights from newly formed synapses. The kind of connections that only happen when you stop trying.

## Database

16 tables across 6 cognitive layers. PostgreSQL with pgvector.

`memory_nodes` (episodic), `memory_synapses` (associative connections), `hippocampal_codes` (DG sparse representations), `emotional_valence` (6D emotional context), `procedural_memories` (skills with proficiency), `cognitive_artifacts` (decisions, learnings, corrections), `dream_cycle_logs`, `self_diagnostics`, `agent_state_logs`, `principal_state`, `background_threads`, `relationship_graph`, `agents` (multi-agent isolation).
